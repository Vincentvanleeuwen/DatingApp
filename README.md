PlayDate is a playdate service that matches you to another dog to play with. The feature I have built is the chat function.

## The main packages required for this feature are
- Node Js
- Express Js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Passport
- Socket IO
- Express-sessions



## Clone to your folder by using
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Vincentvanleeuwen/DatingApp.git
$ cd Datingapp

$ npm install
```

## Start the project by running
```bash
$ npm run dev

// or without eslint

$ npm start
```
